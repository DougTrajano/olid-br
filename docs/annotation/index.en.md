# Annotation

This section describes the [**data annotation process**]{Data annotation is the categorization and labeling of data for AI applications,.} and the [annotators guidelines](#annotators-guidelines) for the dataset.

## Annotation Process

We use [qualified annotators](#who-are-qualified-annotators) to annotate the dataset. The annotators are trained by the authors of the dataset.

### Inter-annotator agreement

The inter-annotator agreement varies depending on the task. Basically, each comment will be tagged by two judges, if they disagree, a third annotator will be used to decide the annotation.

We will provide the Kappa statistic that measures the agreement between the annotators.

## Who are qualified annotators?

A qualified annotator must have the following attributes:
 
- **Basic English** as it has the language used in the annotation tool.
- **Native Portuguese** as the texts presented in the dataset are in Brazilian Portuguese.
- A good understanding of offensive language (in Portuguese) and how to detect it. The concepts will be explained below.

Note takers will be trained by the course [Comunicação Não Violenta - FECAP](https://www.fecap.br/curta-duracao/comunicacao-nao-violenta-1/) with the following syllabus:

- Differences between negativity and toxicity in communication and behavior;
- Toxic people and behavior;
- Assertive behavior and communication;
- Non-violent communication, awareness and non-judgment.
